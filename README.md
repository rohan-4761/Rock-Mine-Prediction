Rock or Mine Prediction with Logistic Regression
This Python notebook project aims to predict whether underwater objects are rocks or mines using Logistic Regression, leveraging SONAR data. 

Overview
Objective: Develop a predictive model for underwater object classification.
Algorithm: Logistic Regression
Dataset: SONAR data

Getting Started
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
